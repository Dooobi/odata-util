# odata-util
This is an OpenUI5 webapp for visualizing OData v2 services.  

It can display a list of all entity types contained in an OData service as well as their definition (properties, keys, complex types).  
It can also display a table with the data for the individual entities where you can delete, update or create new entries.  
The changes are made by sending the corresponding requests to the server according to the [a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) [https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/](OData v2 spec). 

There is also a history of the requests sent to the server and their status.
