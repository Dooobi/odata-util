# odata-util
This is an [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/) web app for visualizing OData v2 services.  

It can display a list of all entity types contained in an OData service as well as their definition (properties, keys, complex types).  
It can also display a table with the data for the individual entities where you can delete, update or create new entries.  
There is also a section for displaying and calling function imports.  

The requests which are sent to the server adhere to the [OData v2 spec](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/).  
The app also displays a history of the requests which you sent to the server. 

The project contains some bugs and there are still some features missing which i might add in the future.
